    <h2>Early Bird Registration is now open!</h2>
    <h4>The importance of registering early</h4>
    <p>The FOSS4G event is presented by the non-profit OSGeo Foundation and is organized by a volunteer Local Organizing Committee. Your early bird registration is the largest funding source for this conference. It is <strong>vitally important to have early registration</strong>        to build momentum and to properly plan for the event. Early information on how many people will be attending will help us put together the best possible conference. We have put together a <strong>very attractive early bird package</strong> that
        will save you money and provide other benefits. </p>
    <p>Boston is a fabulous and busy place to visit in the Summer time. If you know you’re coming you’ll be well served by registering early and making travel and lodging reservations as early as possible. We expect that our conference hotel block at the
        Seaport Hotel - with a fantastic location and very competitive rate - will fill up early. Check out the details below.</p>
