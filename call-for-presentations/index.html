    <h1>The importance of answering this call</h1>

    <p>We need your ideas, talents, knowledge, and insights for the best possible conference!</p>

    <p>The quality of a conference is a function of the people who present and share their ideas, tools,  and content. At FOSS4G, those people are  you, the incredible community that develops and uses free and open source geospatial software. </p>
    
    <p>Presentations may be regular talks (20 minutes plus 5 minutes for Q&A), posters, or maps. We expect to have 200–250 talks selected through this Call, organized in approximately 8 parallel tracks, along with a poster and map gallery.</p>

    <h2>Selection Process</h2>
    <p>The volunteer Program Committee will lead the selection process but you, the attendees, will help through an open <strong>Community Voting</strong> process. The most popular presentations will be included in the program, and the Program Committee will select the remainder to provide a diversity of voices and content.</p>
    <h2>Academic Papers</h2>
    <p>In addition to giving a regular talk or a poster, you may also choose to submit your work as a “long” or “short” academic paper, respectively. All papers will be assessed based on originality and academic rigour, together with interest for the wider FOSS4G community. The volunteer Academic Committee will make an effort to get the best papers published in reputable academic journals, while the remainder may be published in the conference proceedings.</p>
    <p>All presentations with associated papers will be labeled as such in the conference program and will be grouped together with other presentations with similar themes and topics, thereby providing a strong basis for collaboration among researchers, developers, users, and practitioners.
    <h2>Submit a Presentation</h2>
    <p><strong>Submissions opening by the end of January</strong></p>
