    <h2>The importance of answering this Call for Presentations</h2>

    <p>We need your ideas, talents, knowledge, and insights for the best possible conference!</p>

    <p>The quality of a conference is a function of the people who present and share their ideas, tools,  and content. At FOSS4G, those people are  you, the incredible community that develops and uses free and open source geospatial software. </p>

    <p>Presentations may be regular talks (20 minutes plus 5 minutes for Q&amp;A), posters, or maps. We expect to have 200–250 talks selected through this Call, organized in approximately 8 parallel tracks, along with a poster and map gallery.</p>

    <p>The Program Committee is looking for <strong>a variety of different types of stories across a broad range of sectors and industries</strong>, covering the full breadth and depth of the free and open source software that are <em>Empowering Geospatial</em>. During the presentations proposal process you will be asked to tag your abstract in the following ways:
    </p>
    <h4>Themes — one general area that describes your presentation:</h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>FOSS4G Development</dt>

    <h2>Selection Process</h2>
    <p>The volunteer Program Committee will lead the selection process but you, the attendees, will help through an open <strong>Community Voting</strong> process. The most popular presentations will be included in the program, and the Program Committee will select the remainder to provide a diversity of voices and content.</p>
    <h2>Academic Papers</h2>
    <p>In addition to giving a regular talk or a poster, you may also choose to submit your work as a “long” or “short” academic paper, respectively, with the goal of publication post-conference. Under the direction of the volunteer Academic Committee, all papers will be assessed anonymously by geospatial experts based on originality and academic rigor, together with interest for the wider FOSS4G community. We expect to select 20-25 papers for dissemination as preprints at the conference.</p>
    <p>All presentations with selected papers will be labeled as “academic presentations” in the conference program and will be grouped together with other presentations with similar themes and topics, thereby providing a strong basis for collaboration among researchers, developers, users, and practitioners.</p>
    <p>With feedback from the presentations and the editors, a final round of editing will occur to ensure high-quality papers. An effort will be made to get the best papers published in reputable academic journals, while the remainder will be published in the <a href="http://journal.osgeo.org/index.php/journal">OSGeo Journal</a>, the official journal of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation.</p>
    <h2>Submit a Presentation</h2>
    <p><strong>Submissions opening by the end of January</strong></p>
