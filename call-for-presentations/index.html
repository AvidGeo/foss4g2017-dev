    <h1>The importance of answering this call</h1>

    <p>We need your ideas, talents, and insights for the best possible conference!</p>

    <p>The quality of a conference is a function of the people who present and share their ideas, tools,  and content. At FOSS4G, those people are  you, the incredible community that develops and uses free and open-source geospatial software.</p>

    <p>We expect to have 200–250 talks selected through this Call for Presentations. Keynote and invited presentations will round out the program. The volunteer FOSS4G Program Committee will lead the process but you, the attendees, will help select the presentations through an open Community Voting process. The most popular presentations will be included in the program, and the Program Committee will select the remainder to provide a diversity of voices and content.</p>
