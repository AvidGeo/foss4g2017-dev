    <h4>Sales and Marketing 101 for FOSS4G Businesses: A workshop for Open Spatial IT Entrepreneurs</h4>
    <p>Most FOSS4G businesses start from a strong technical foundation with experienced developers, consultants and contributors to OSGeo projects. Often the founders have less experience in sales and marketing and have to “pick this stuff up along the way”.
      This workshop aims to provide senior managers of small FOSS4G businesses with a grounding in basic sales and marketing techniques that should help to grow your business profitably. The workshop is targeted at “one man bands” through to SME businesses
      with 10 to 15 employees (we expect that larger businesses will already have an understanding of these basic concepts). Some preparation prior to the workshop is essential, an exercise will be sent to all delegates at least 4 weeks prior to the workshop.
      As the various components of the workshop build upon each other, it is strongly recommended that delegates attend all sessions of this workshop. If you have more than one person involved in commercial activities you may benefit from sending a team
      of two delegates to the workshop.</p>

    <h4>Real-time 3D visualization of geospatial data using Blender</h4>
    <p>What if your geospatial data and simulations (e.g., flooding or fire-spread) are converted on-the-fly into realistic, interactive and immersive 3D worlds, without the need to deal with overly complicated or proprietary 3D modelling software? In this
      hands-on workshop we will explore how to automate importing and processing of various types of geospatial data (e.g., rasters, vectors) using Blender, an open-source 3D modelling and game engine software. We will start with a brief and focused introduction
      into Blender graphical user interface (GUI), Python API, as well as the GIS and Virtual reality addons. Once we import our GIS data into Blender, we will go over the techniques (both with GUI and command line) to increase the realism of our 3D world
      through applying textures, shading, and lighting. To make our work reusable for different projects, we will automate all importing and processing workflows using Python. Finally, we will show how to display our 3D visualization in virtual reality
      headsets, and how to publish it online to share it with the world.

    <h4>Web 3D Geospatial Made Easy: An Introduction to Cesium</h4>
    <p>Why settle for 2D maps? 3D geospatial unlocks a world of new features, such as accurate trajectory visualization, dynamic shadows, realistic bumped terrain, 3D models, and more.</p>
    <p>This hands-on workshop will introduce first-time users to Cesium, the leading open-source JavaScript library for 3D geospatial visualization on the web. Cesium provides a lightweight, but expressive set of tools for building 3D map applications for
      any platform using industry-standard vector data formats such as KML, GeoJSON and TopoJSON. By providing a set of readable 3D-scene data formats and code examples, Cesium aims to make it easy for anyone to get started with 3D geospatial visualization,
      not just experienced developers! This workshop will provide a hands-on tour of Cesium’s most popular features in the context of start-to-finish app development.</p>
    <p>By developing a set of sample applications, attendees will learn how to import different types of data -- such as imagery layers, 3D cites, terrain and point cloud data – then annotate, fuse and display them using Cesium’s powerful core library. Our
      sample applications will explore Cesium’s most popular features, including 3D camera navigation, terrain collision-detection, object-picking, 3D model animations, and a variety of 2D and 3D geometry editing and styling tools.</p>
    <p>By the end of class, attendees will have a working understanding of how to quickly develop and extend 3D applications with Cesium.</p>

    <h4>Geo with R? Yes We Can!</h4>
    <p>R is a powerful open source software environment and programming language most widely known for statistical computing, beautiful and fully customizable graphics, and mind-bending flexibility. In recent years, a surge in the development of geospatial
      packages has enabled R to become a fully functional command line GIS as well. Traditionally used by scientists, statisticians, and students, a new door has opened for geospatial analysts – that door leads down a path of compelling, reproducible
      analyses and visualizations all generated within one application, which also happens to play nicely with other popular open source tools, like QGIS.</p>
    <p>In this introductory workshop, participants will discover the excitement of solving common geospatial puzzles with R. Hands-on exercises will concentrate on several focal areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Learning basic programming structures and syntax in R.</li>
      <li>Gaining familiarity with the most common geo packages.</li>
      <li>Understanding how to access, preprocess, explore, and analyze spatial data (e.g., projections, clipping, intersecting, joining, etc.) in R.</li>
      <li>Got rasters? No problem! Remote sensing in R.</li>
      <li>Spatial statistics – finding patterns, modeling, etc.</li>
      <li>Visualization and maps</li>
      <li>Extras if time:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Integration of R and QGIS (a two-way street!)</li>
        <li>Web maps</li>
        <li>Big data and parallel processing</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>By the end of the workshop, participants can expect to have the skills necessary to complete several common geoprocessing tasks, explore data structure and uncover patterns, and visualize their data and results. Most of all, they will leave with a
      sense of what is possible and resources for advancing their skills.</p>

    <h4>From WebODM to QGIS</h4>
    <p>‘Using OpenDroneMap Web to manipulate aerial images into ortophoto, DSM and Point Cloud.’</p>
    <p>The goal of this workshop is to introduce a workflow from aerial images to GIS data. At the University of Copenhagen, Foresty College, students work with dataset in real projects. They need to get a realistic approach to what they can and can´t retrieve
      from data collected with UAV. We have small UAVs with RGB and Spectral cameras which we use. In this workshop we will show how data are processed in OpenDroneMap Web. The participants will then work with the resulting data: Ortophoto, DSM and Point
      Clouds
    </p>
    <p>Working with the datasets in QGIS/LAStools/potree/Fugroviewer: In Fugroviewer: Viewing the Point Cloud; In QGIS(LASTools/Potree): Open Ortophoto, Open DSM and create a Hillshade, Classifying Point Cloud into ‘Ground’ and ‘Unclassified’, Creating DTM

    <h4>OGC SensorThings API with GOST</h4>
    <p>The OGC SensorThings API (https://github.com/opengeospatial/sensorthings) is an open standard to interconnect IoT devices, data and applications over the web. It builds on web protocols and OGC Sensor Web Enablement standards and applies an easy-to-use
      REST-like interface. GOST (https://github.com/geodan/gost) is an open source SensorThings API compliant server, written in Golang, that provides an easy way to connect various types of sensors, store the measurements and provide a unified, location
      aware stream of results. These streams can be monitored using dashboards or displayed on maps.</p>
    <p>After a short introduction of the SensorThings API we will dive into GOST. Using Docker the participants will be able to install GOST on Windows, Mac or Linux in a few simple steps. Once it is installed the developers will guide you in configuring
      GOST, connecting a few sensors and monitoring the measurements with GOST. We will also show you how to use the visual wiring tool Node-RED to connect sensors to GOST using the MQTT protocol.</p>
    <p>If you bring your own sensors to the workshop we will help you to hook them up to GOST.</p>

    <h4>Apache Solr Spatial Search</h4>
    <p>Apache Solr is an incredibly popular search platform, and its got lots of geospatial tricks up its sleeves too. Solr should be of interest to those in the spatial community for its fantastic keyword search capabilities, faceted navigation, and query
      completion – all features that search platforms excel at whereas databases or other persistence solutions fall far short.</p>
    <p>In this workshop, you’ll learn how to start Solr (using Docker), configure it for geospatial data, and to import polygonal geometry from a shapefile using GDAL/OGR. We’ll also import some point data. On the query side, we’ll search for it in different
      ways, sort points by distance, and generate heatmap data. Following the spatial centric part, we’ll then venture into popular features Solr is known for like keyword search and faceting. Finally the presenter will show a behind-the-scenes look at
      a scaled out installation of Solr with a billion geo-tweets that employs some of the same features discussed.</p>

    <h4>Browser-based Geoprocessing with Turf.js and Leaflet</h4>
    <p>This workshop teaches how to use the JavaScript library Turf.js to execute client-side geoprocessing tasks. Browser-based geoprocessing is an alternative to using Web Processing Services (WPS), which require a complex server-side infrastructure and
      which take longer to return results even for trivial tasks and whose setup requires a considerable set of skills and necessary user permissions. Turf.js is a pure JavaScript library, meaning that anyone with a basic knowledge of JavaScript can get
      started quickly. Turf.js is very well documented, flexible, and user friendly. It offers a multitude of geoprocessing tools, covering all the classics that are used in every desktop GIS software (e.g. buffer, erase, intersect, merge) and many advanced
      features.
    </p>
    <p>During the workshop, a variety of examples as well as live coding will be shown using Leaflet as a mapping client. Participants will also be introduced how to use Turf.js with OpenLayers. Participants will first be taught how to set up a simple map
      and then will be walked through preparing datasets from various formats (e.g. KML, GPX, Shapefile), so they can be used with Turf.js which requires GeoJSON as input. This will be followed by the presentation of various tools, as well as the combination
      of them, to conduct meaningful geospatial analysis and queries whose results can be displayed and exported.</p>

    <p>Introduction to Leaflet and D3 for beginners. Never made your own web map before? This is your chance! In this workshop you will learn the very basics of making a web map with Leaflet and D3.</p>
    <p>With LeafletJS you can make interactive web maps for all devices. Leaflet is an open source JavaScript library made by Vladimir Agafonkin.</p>
    <p>D3 stands for Data Driven Documents. The data you provide yourself. D3 makes the connection between your data and the ('driven') documents, which are web-based (HTML and SVG). D3.js is developed by Mike Bostock and completely open source. With D3,
      you can make beautiful interactive visualizations, graphs of your date but also: a map!</p>
    <p>Do not be afraid if you do not know HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this tutorial will help you along from the very beginning! At the end of this workshop you will know how to create your own web map, style it and even put some custom data in there. </p>

    <h4>Building Standards Compliant Geospatial Web Applications - the Quick and Easy MapMint Way</h4>
    <p>This workshop will introduce the MapMint framework that provides quick and easy way to build and manage geospatial web applications using Open Source, Open Standards and Open Data. The MapMint is a development framework built based on ZOO-Project,
      MapServer, GDAL/OGR on the server side and jQuery, Bootstrap and OpenLayers on the client side. The MapMint framework is built on the principle that "Everything is a Service", including data oriented services such as WMS, WFS, WFS-T, WCS and WMTS
      and task oriented services by deploying WPS based on existing geospatial libraries such as GDAL/OGR, pgRouting, R etc. After a brief presentation of every modules and general workflow to create and publish a webmapping application, the MapMint Manager
      will be used to edit web maps application and create style for layers. Finally, the MapMint Publisher will be used to define modules to be included in the web application accessible from any browser on computer or mobile devices.</p>

    <h4>From hours to seconds: Multi-dimensional indexing with GeoWave and HBase</h4>
    <p>Participants in this workshop will learn how to use GeoWave’s multidimensional indexing capabilities to preserve spatial and spatial-temporal locality in a distributed key value store. Each participant will set up a test cluster on his or her own
      machine using the GeoWave RPMs and Docker. We will then use the GeoWave command line functionality to ingest and analyze multidimensional vector and raster data. The participants will also use our GeoWave Geoserver plugins to render their data.
      We will use Apache HBase as our key value store in this workshop, however, GeoWave supports additional stores and some time will be given to help users who wish to implement GeoWave with a different one.</p>
    <p>This workshop is targeted towards developers looking to leverage the benefits of Big Data distributed technologies with large geospatial datasets. Participants will need to be able to run Docker on their local machine to participate in this workshop.</p>
    <p>GeoWave was open sourced on June 9, 2014 under the Apache 2.0 License and is under active development by DigitalGlobe developers on GitHub. At its core, GeoWave is a software library that connects the scalability of distributed computing frameworks
      and key-value stores with modern geospatial software to store, retrieve and analyze massive geospatial datasets.</p>

    <h4>Advanced Spatial Analysis with PostGIS</h4>
    <p>You think you know PostGIS? In this tutorial you will learn what is not in the books, nor in the blogs. Pierre Racine is one of the two guys behind the PostGIS Raster API. He also launched the PostGIS Addons, the easiest way to add functionalities
      to PostGIS. He has been pushing PostGIS to its limits in many ways since 2004. He will show you how to use the most mysterious raster functions, what are the best methods to rasterize a vector coverage, how to search nearest neighbors for thousands
      of geometries at a time, how to remove overlaps from a vector coverage and more!</p>
    <p>We will assume that you have PostgreSQL (9.6 and up), PgAdmin and PostGIS (2.3.x) as well as OpenJump installed and running on your laptop BEFORE the beginning of the session. We will not cover installation and configuration. Only funny SQL jargon!
      Make also sure you can execute shp2pgsql from your command line window and to give at least 2048M of RAM to OpenJump with the -Xmx option in the oj_linux.sh or the oj_windows.bat launching script (newest versions of OpenJump do not need this setting).</p>

    <h4>Breaking the 4th Dimension: Working with time in PostgreSQL and PostGIS</h4>
    <p>It is “well known” that 80% of all data has a spatial component. What is less well known is that 100% of data contains a temporal component. For some data it may simply be the date that the data was released. For other, there may be a separate date/time
      for each separate row or feature. And yet still for others, such as vehicle tracks, there is time information that changes along a feature itself.</p>
    <p>This talk will demonstrate approaches for dealing with time in PostgreSQL including data types and their limitations along with range types and other functions available for dealing with time.</p>
    <p>This talk will also dive into the use of linear referencing for exploring data such as track data.</p>
    <p>Finally this talk will touch on the use of advanced PostgreSQL topics such as using windowing functions and how they can be used to find information such as speed or direction along a track.</p>

    <h4>Mapping American Community Survey with R</h4>
    <p>The American Community Survey (ACS) annually collects and disseminates a wealth of demographic and economic data, including race, sex, age, occupation, household income, commuting behavior, disability status, etc. The US Census Bureau exposes ACS
      data via API and the R packages `tigris` and `acs` automate the downloading and joining of Census geographies and demographic data. This workshop will introduce the users to the data available in ACS and the use of R, RStudio, and `tigris` and `acs`
      packages to map selected ACS variables. <br /> <br /> Package installation and data downloads will require a device with functional networking. All tools are cross-platform, and attendees are encouraged to work in whatever OS they prefer. The tools
      will be demonstrated in a Linux environment. <br /> <br /> Attendees will be introduced to different levels of Census geography, identifying data of interest, and mapping it in R. They will also learn how to combine Census data with other data of
      interest. The workshop will use US county-level presidential election data as a case study. However, attendees are encouraged to bring other data (preferably county-level as well) that they are interested in mapping.</p>

    <h4>Field data collection in disconnected environments: Portable OpenStreetMap (POSM) from start to finish</h4>
    <p>OpenStreetMap tools are amazing, but can be difficult in remote environments or areas with uncertain internet connectivity. To bridge the gap between online and disconnected environments, we developed Portable OpenStreetMap (POSM). <br /> <br /> POSM
      combines offline OSM editing tools (iD Editor, JOSM, et al.), Field Papers, OpenMapKit/OpenDataKit, OpenDroneMap, support for offline mapathons, a captive portal, and many new enhancements to OSM-based data collection workflows. Using very cheap
      hardware (
      <$300), contributors are able to download an area of interest, work offline in the field with familiar tools, build off of these changes, and finally return to a connected environment and sync all changes back to OpenStreetMap. <br /> <br /> Last year, we presented POSM to FOSS4G for the first time. Since then, the Red Cross has used POSM extensively in Ecuador and West Africa and we’ve added several new features. This session builds from last year’s content to not only introduce
      participants to POSM and its potential uses, but to give them hands-on experience assembling, configuring, and using the device and the tools that it supports. We will cover the complete workflow for offline OSM editing, mobile data collection using
      POSM, and data cleaning and synchronization required at project completion. <br /> <br /> By the end of the workshop, participants will feel comfortable with the process for setting up and conducting an offline data collection project. This is a
      beginner-friendly session but we will also dive into more advanced questions and topics as time and audience allows. <br /> </p>

    <h4>Classification of remote sensing images with the Orfeo ToolBox and QGIS</h4>
    <p>This tutorial is a step by step guide to the classification tools available in the Orfeo ToolBox [1]. Tailored for big reference data and images, those tools inter-operates easily with GIS software such as Qgis [2], allowing for in depth analysis
      of the supervised classification process. <br /> <br /> After a short introduction to the Orfeo ToolBox, we will start from a Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 time series and real world reference data used to produce national land cover maps. We will review
      all the steps of the classification framework : samples selection, feature extraction, learning with different machine learning algorithms and features selection, classification and accuracy assessment. <br /> <br /> At the end of the tutorial,
      it is expected that the participants will be able to perform the full classification framework with Orfeo ToolBox and QGIS on their own data. <br /> <br /> After attending this tutorial, participants will also be able to discover and use other tools
      from the toolkit on their own (such as remote sensing preprocessing or segmentation). <br /> <br /> [1] https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/ <br /> [2] http://qgis.org/fr/site/ <br /> [3] http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/multitemp/?p=6382</p>

    <h4>Using GeoBlacklight for Geospatial Discovery</h4>
    <p>Providing effective discovery services has been a key challenge for many organizations who publish geospatial data. Even though geospatial discovery services are a critical area in Open Source GIS, solutions are underdeveloped or suffer from usability
      issues. <br /> <br /> GeoBlacklight is a Ruby on Rails platform for building a geospatial discovery application. The aim of the project is to provide a simple, effective open-source application for discovery of geospatial data. Users can search
      by text, facet, or map to access federated geospatial resources that can be previewed and downloaded directly. It is open source and community driven, focused on discovery-oriented use cases, and builds upon the Blacklight discovery platform. <br
      /> <br /> In this hands-on workshop, participants will learn: about GeoBlacklight and see demonstrations of GeoBlacklight applications in production; how to install an instance on their laptop; and how to customize GeoBlacklight and use its schema
      to describe geospatial resources. <br /> <br /> No prior experience is required to participate in the workshop, and developers, managers, and others are welcome to attend. <br /> </p>

    <h4>Analyzing large raster data in a Jupyter notebook with GeoPySpark on AWS</h4>
    <p>This workshop will focus on doing analytics on large scale raster data in python through a Jupyter notebook. <br /> <br /> If you work with raster data like satellite imagery or elevation data, you might have run into the "Big Data" problem: analyzing
      and transforming very large sets of rasters proves to be a difficult challenge. GeoTrellis is a library for processing and analyzing large raster data with Apache Spark. It is written for the Scala language, which does not have as large of a following,
      particularly in the geopsatial developer community, as Python. To account for this, Spark, which is also written in Scala, has python bindings (PySpark) that allow jobs to be written in Python and executed against a Spark cluster. The GeoTrellis
      developers have followed PySpark's example and have created the GeoPySpark project. This project opens up to Python developers the ability to process large raster data with the power of GeoTrellis and Spark, and establishes a framework for encorporating
      Python usage with other Spark-based geospatial projects such as GeoMesa. With GeoPySpark, pythonistas have access to the power of GeoTrellis, while still being able to use the tools they are familiar (i.e. numpy). All this functionality is accessable
      through Jupyter notebooks, which lend themselves to be simple and effective ways to interact with Spark clusters. <br /> <br /> Attendees should leave this workshop having learned about Spark, GeoTrellis, Jupyter and Amazon Web Services, and be
      armed with the knowledge necessary to take on Big Raster Data problems using Python.</p>

    <h4>GIS in the Cloud: Get your GIS API Online with Docker + ECS</h4>
    <p>In the online GIS world, client-side slippy-maps and data entry are the straw, but where’s the milkshake? It’s in the rainbow of back-end services that power your web application. Best practices for the: development, testing, deployment, scaling and
      monitoring of back-end services are changing very rapidly. Docker and “microservices” have emerged as robust tools/architectural patterns for speeding development, creating consistent environments for deployment and building in scalability from
      the get-go. <br /> <br /> This workshop will do a start to finish, hands-on, how-to using Docker, PostgreSQL + PostGIS, Python and Amazon’s ECS (Elastic Container Service) to launch an inherently-scalable, inexpensive, web-based GIS microservice,
      which can power an HTML5/JS web-based, or mobile-native front-end. <br /> <br /> The pattern in this workshop can be directly applied to any web-based microservice, and time will be allocated to discussing the balance between scalability, price,
      performance and continuity of service. <br /> </p>

    <h4>Building SDIs and geoportals with GeoNode and a search engine</h4>
    <p>WorldMap [1] is an SDI/GeoPortal project running since 2010, that exposes 25k+ internal layers, 200k+ remote layers, 7k+ maps and used by 20k+ registered users. It is built on top of GeoNode and its core components, such as Django, GeoServer, GeoWebCache,
      PostgreSQL/PostGIS, pycsw and GeoExplorer. Users can build maps with a web browser using the internal layers (stored in the PostGIS database and the filesystem and exposed by GeoServer as OGC web services) and the remote layers, exposed by external
      OGC and ESRI Rest Web Services. Remote layers are harvested, health checked, processed and exposed with a system based on Python and MapProxy. A search engine, based on Solr and Lucene, enriches the WorldMap user's experience providing powerful
      features such as keyword, spatial and temporal facets, full text search, natural language processing, weighted results and much more. <br /><br /> The organizers will lead the workshop’s participant, with a series of step by step tutorials, to setup
      a development environment containing all the needed components, to get a basic understanding of the solution stack involved to replicate such an architecture in their own geoportals/SDIs implementation, and to discuss optimization techniques for
      taking advantage of the solution for handling a large number of datasets. <br /> <br /> [1] http://worldmap.harvard.edu/</p>

    <h4>Growing a Geocoder: sprout in containers, transplant to the cloud</h4>
    <p>This workshop will walk the participants through the process of "sprouting" a local instance of the Pelias geocoder using a Docker container and open-data sources, such as OpenStreetMap, OpenAddresses, and Who's on First. We will focus this local
      setup on a small region, to keep the data size manageable. Once it's running, we'll go over all the capabilities of the geocoder API, such as forward, reverse, and structured geocoding, as well as autocomplete. This part is perfect for beginners
      and advanced GIS professionals alike! <br /> <br /> For those that have geo-data lying around but no tool with which to search it, there will be a hands-on guide for implementing a custom importer for data not available in the supported open-data
      sources. Once completed, the geocoder should be able to return results containing the custom data. Here things will get a little more involved and would be best suited for those with familiarity with JavaScript. <br /> <br /> Next, we will show
      the class how to "transplant" the geocoder to the cloud. This part of the workshop will be a guided tour of an existing simple cloud setup of Pelias. We'll discuss some of the key concerns when hosting the geocoder in a cloud environment with larger
      coverage regions. Fair warning: the cloud is not for the faint of heart and calls for intermediate to advanced technical know-how. <br /> <br /> After this workshop, attendees of all skill levels will be able to successfully "cultivate" their own
      Pelias geocoder instances in a variety of environments and data coverage requirements.</p>

    <h4>ZOO-Project Introduction Workshop</h4>
    <p>The ZOO-Project is an open source software which provides a WPS (Web Processing Service) compliant and developer-friendly framework to easily create and chain OGC Webservices. The ZOO-Project is made of four parts. ZOO-Kernel is a powerful server-side
      C Kernel which makes possible to manage and chain Web services coded in different programming languages. ZOO-Services is a growing suite of example Web services based on various Open Source libraries. ZOO-API is a server-side JavaScript API able
      to call and chain the ZOO Services, which makes the development and chaining processes easier, and ZOO-Client is a JavaScript library to interact with WPS servers from your web applications.</p>
    <p>The ZOO-Project will first be presented, along with few details on using the WPS (1.0.0 and 2.0.0). The participants will first learn how to setup the ZOO Kernel and to get a WPS server running in a few simple steps. Some basic services will be presented
      to the attendees to give them the capability to reuse them later in their own application. Then, they will learn how to develop simple WPS service using the Python language, trough simple programing exercises. A ready to use client will be used
      to interact with the available WPS Services and the one to be developed. Participants will finally learn how to chain the different available WPS Services using the server-side Javascript ZOO-API. The final client application, based on ZOO-Client,
      will provide a user interface to first search and display of shortest path, then display the corresponding profile.</p>

    <p>PyWPS is an open source, light-weight, Python based, implementation of the OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) standard. It provides users with a relatively seamless environment where to code geo-spatial functions and models that are readily exposed
      to the Internet through the WWW. <br /> <br /> PyWPS offers a straightforward WPS development framework with the increasingly popular Python language. Python offers easy access to a vast array of code libraries that can be easily used in the processes,
      in particular those for geo-spatial data manipulation, e.g. GRASS, GDAL/OGR, Fiona, Shapely, etc., but also to statistics packages (e.g. rpy2 for R statistics) and data analysis tools (e.g. pandas). PyWPS offers storage mechanisms for process inputs
      and outputs and spawns processes to the background for asynchronous execution requests. <br /> <br /> The workshop is focused on installation and configuration of PyWPS. Next, we create new process - this will demonstrate, how to define process
      inputs and outputs and discuss various data types. Finally we will focus on the execute function - the soul and body of every process. This is the place, where the analysis takes place. This is the place, where you make your "global climate change
      model" or "add two raster maps".</p>

    <h4>Hex bin data from PostGIS as dynamic multi-variate themed maps with Leaflet or OpenLayers on a Node.js backend</h4>
    <p>The workshop will show the user how a regular raster can be turned into multiple hex grid layers. The hex grid layers are then merged with data from census reporting units. The result will be a set of layers for different scales with census data being
      merged across boundaries and distributed within the reporting units according to the Global Human Settlement population grid.</p>

    <h4>Building on the work of giants; A beginners guide for adding functionality using 3rd Party APIs.</h4>
    <p>Building tools based on 3rd party APIs can sometimes be intimidating to start from scratch, so we use plugins and other abstractions and don't develop a good understanding of how we're actually interacting with the API. <br /> <br /> In this workshop
      we will walk through the steps it takes to use the Mapzen Mobility API to add turn-by-turn navigation to an off-the-shelf OpenLayers 3 map. We're going to learn where we need to look for the web and client library API documentation, how to read
      that documentation so that it makes sense. <br /> <br /> We'll then build our routing solution from scratch iterating from basic proof-of-concept to a tool that you would be proud to include in your next online map. <br /> <br /> Participants will
      need to bring a computer, but we'll be leveraging some awesome web applications for hosting and editing our projects so no fancy software is required for this workshop. While no prior coding experience is required some exposure to JavaScript will
      come in handy, more important though, is the desire to learn something new!</p>

    <h4>Enterprise class deployment for GeoServer and GeoWebcache: optimizing performances and availability</h4>
    <p>This workshop will provide guidance and hands on experience on how to optimize the performance and availability of GeoServer and GeoWebCache, including:
      <ul>
        <li>Load testing a OGC service with JMeter (this skills will be used to measure the improvements got with the other improvements)</li>
        <li>Optimizing vector and raster data for the needs of Web GIS workloads</li>
        <li>Optimize styling to provide a good balance between map navigability and performance, identifying common performance pitfalls in the styling options</li>
        <li>Comparing output formats performance and network usage</li>
        <li>Configuring WMS/WFS/WCS service limits to ensure stability resource usage fairness</li>
        <li>Setting up the control-flow extension to tune each service to its maximum performance</li>
        <li>Setting up caching with GWC for the background layers, identify layers and situations that are not suitable for caching</li>
        <li>Using the monitoring extension to control the server in production and identify sources of trouble (long request, clients making too many/too heavy requests, layers and services used the most that could use more tuning attention)</li>
      </ul>

    <h4>Hands on with GDAL/OGR: a gentle introduction to command line GIS</h4>
    <p>GDAL/OGR is a life-changing toolset. But for those who haven’t yet tried it, getting started on your own can be difficult. Unfamiliarity with command line interfaces can make it especially daunting. This beginner-focused workshop introduces some of
      the most frequently-used features. Since we’ll focus only on using GDAL/OGR tools from the command line, no programming experience is necessary. <br /> <br /> Attendees will need to come with GDAL/OGR already installed on their laptops: we’ll email
      easy-to-follow tutorials for Windows, Mac, and (most) Linux users in advance of the class date. We’ll also be available before class to help anyone who was unable to complete installation on their own. <br /> <br /> This workshop will target the
      absolute beginner: not just to GDAL/OGR, but also potentially to command-line tools or even FOSS GIS as a whole. GDAL/OGR is a fantastic toolset to keep in your geospatial toolbox, and it can be an eye-opening introduction to the world of FOSS GIS.
      Regardless of background or experience level, we want everyone to learn about this awesome, free &amp; open source tool; our workshop aims to help beginners over the hurdles along the way.</p>
